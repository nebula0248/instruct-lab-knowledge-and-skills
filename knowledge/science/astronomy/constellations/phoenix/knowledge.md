# Phoenix (constellation)

**Phoenix** is a minor [constellation](constellation "wikilink") in the
[southern sky](southern_sky "wikilink"). Named after the mythical
[phoenix](Phoenix_(mythology) "wikilink"), it was first depicted on a
celestial atlas by [Johann Bayer](Johann_Bayer "wikilink") in his 1603
*[Uranometria](Uranometria "wikilink")*. The French explorer and
astronomer [Nicolas Louis de
Lacaille](Nicolas_Louis_de_Lacaille "wikilink") charted the brighter
stars and gave their [Bayer designations](Bayer_designation "wikilink")
in 1756. The constellation stretches from roughly −39 degrees to −57 degrees
[declination](declination "wikilink"), and from 23.5h to 2.5h of [right
ascension](right_ascension "wikilink"). The constellations Phoenix,
[Grus](Grus_(constellation) "wikilink"),
[Pavo](Pavo_(constellation) "wikilink") and [Tucana](Tucana "wikilink"),
are known as the Southern Birds.

The brightest star, [Alpha Phoenicis](Alpha_Phoenicis "wikilink"), is
named Ankaa, an [Arabic](Arabic "wikilink") word meaning 'the Phoenix'.
It is an orange giant of apparent magnitude 2.4. Next is [Beta
Phoenicis](Beta_Phoenicis "wikilink"), actually a
[binary](Binary_star "wikilink") system composed of two yellow giants
with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.3. [Nu
Phoenicis](Nu_Phoenicis "wikilink") has a dust disk, while the
constellation has ten star systems with known planets and the recently
discovered [galaxy clusters](galaxy_cluster "wikilink") [El
Gordo](El_Gordo_(galaxy_cluster) "wikilink") and the [Phoenix
Cluster](Phoenix_Cluster "wikilink")—located 7.2 and 5.7 billion light
years away respectively, two of the largest objects in the [visible
universe](visible_universe "wikilink"). Phoenix is the
[radiant](radiant_(meteor_shower) "wikilink") of two annual [meteor
showers](meteor_shower "wikilink"): the
[Phoenicids](Phoenicids "wikilink") in December, and the July
Phoenicids.

## History

Phoenix was the largest of the 12 constellations established by [Petrus
Plancius](Petrus_Plancius "wikilink") from the observations of [Pieter
Dirkszoon Keyser](Pieter_Dirkszoon_Keyser "wikilink") and [Frederick de
Houtman](Frederick_de_Houtman "wikilink"). It first appeared on a 35-cm
diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by
Plancius with [Jodocus Hondius](Jodocus_Hondius "wikilink"). The first
depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in [Johann
Bayer](Johann_Bayer "wikilink")'s
*[Uranometria](Uranometria "wikilink")* of 1603. De Houtman included
it in his southern star catalog the same year under the Dutch name *Den
voghel Fenicx*, "The Bird Phoenix", symbolising the
[phoenix](Phoenix_(mythology) "wikilink") of classical mythology. One
name of the brightest star [Alpha
Phoenicis](Alpha_Phoenicis "wikilink")—Ankaa—is derived from the Arabic:
العنقاء, romanized: al-‘anqā’, lit. 'the phoenix', and
was coined sometime after 1800 in relation to the constellation.

Celestial historian Richard Allen noted that unlike the other
constellations introduced by Plancius and [La
Caille](La_Caille "wikilink"), Phoenix has actual precedent in ancient
astronomy, as the Arabs saw this formation as representing young
ostriches, *Al Ri'āl*, or as a griffin or eagle. In addition, the
same group of stars was sometimes imagined by the Arabs as a boat, *Al
Zaurak*, on the nearby river Eridanus. He observed, "the introduction
of a Phoenix into modern astronomy was, in a measure, by adoption rather
than by invention."

The Chinese incorporated Phoenix's brightest star, Ankaa (Alpha
Phoenicis), and stars from the adjacent constellation
[Sculptor](Sculptor_(constellation) "wikilink") to depict *Bakui*, a net
for catching birds. Phoenix and the neighbouring constellation of
[Grus](Grus_(constellation) "wikilink") together were seen by [Julius
Schiller](Julius_Schiller "wikilink") as portraying
[Aaron](Aaron "wikilink") the High Priest. These two constellations,
along with nearby [Pavo](Pavo_(constellation) "wikilink") and
[Tucana](Tucana "wikilink"), are called the Southern Birds.

## Characteristics

Phoenix is a small constellation bordered by [Fornax](Fornax "wikilink")
and Sculptor to the north, Grus to the west, Tucana to the south,
touching on the corner of [Hydrus](Hydrus "wikilink") to the south, and
[Eridanus](Eridanus_(constellation) "wikilink") to the east and
southeast. The bright star [Achernar](Achernar "wikilink") is
nearby. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as
adopted by the [International Astronomical
Union](International_Astronomical_Union "wikilink") in 1922, is
"Phe". The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian
astronomer [Eugène Delporte](Eugène_Joseph_Delporte "wikilink") in 1930,
are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the [equatorial coordinate
system](equatorial_coordinate_system "wikilink"), the [right
ascension](right_ascension "wikilink") coordinates of these borders lie
between 23<sup>h</sup> 26.5<sup>m</sup> and 02<sup>h</sup> 25.0<sup>m</sup>,
while the [declination](declination "wikilink")
coordinates are between −39.31° and −57.84°. This means it remains
below the horizon to anyone living north of the [40th
parallel](40th_parallel_north "wikilink") in the [Northern
Hemisphere](Northern_Hemisphere "wikilink"), and remains low in the sky
for anyone living north of the [equator](equator "wikilink"). It is most
visible from locations such as Australia and South Africa during late
[Southern Hemisphere](Southern_Hemisphere "wikilink") spring. Most
of the constellation lies within, and can be located by, forming a
triangle of the bright stars Achernar, [Fomalhaut](Fomalhaut "wikilink")
and [Beta Ceti](Beta_Ceti "wikilink")—Ankaa lies roughly in the centre
of this.
